# ROS-Industrial Consortium

Welcome to the ROS-Industrial Consortium GitHub organization.

## Purpose

The ROS-Industrial open source project is supported by regional consortia stewarded in the Americas, the European Union and the Asia Pacific regions. These consortia collaborate and work with their members to provide example applications and foundational capabilities and additional resources to the members. This GitHub organization supports consortia generated projects, modules and resources to enable industrial leverage of ROS and ROS 2 specifically, in industrial settings.

ROS-Industrial is not a replacement for ROS but is intended to work within the ROS ecosystem. The strategy has been to provide utilities and resources in a ROS agnostic way to provide those interested in leveraging ROS and ROS 2 resources in the way that meets their needs. Many of the core developed resources are ROS agnostic with ROS or ROS 2 wrappers provided. In some cases specific ROS and ROS 2 versions are maintained and this is determined based on the nature of the resource and how it interacts with the ROS or ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Status of repositories

In many cases consortia supported projects are open source and business friendly licensed. There are on occasion member only repositories, by which these are restricted to specific members, regions or teams. Specific to Focused Technical Projects (FTP) these repositories will become open source after a period of time. All the repositories herein are actively supported, by the supporting teams and the supporting consortia organizations of the specific project.

## Issue trackers and Pull Requests

We welcome engagement with the projects via issue trackers and welcome pul requests and discussions around the future projection and opportunities for improvement of any the projects within the organization.
